# Release notes

## Unreleased

_Unreleased_

- `Added` Renamed the product to Archive Manager and the file action to Open archive
- `Added` Explorer Action v5 browses archives in the native AutoJs6 file list with the existing path bar, theme, and Back navigation
- `Added` Explorer Action v6 opens supported archive entries with the host document, image, audio, and video viewers
- `Added` Extract to... shortcut for choosing a destination and extracting the entire archive
- `Added` Explorer Action v4 adds Compress... to ordinary file and folder menus and to the five-action same-parent multi-selection bar
- `Added` ZIP creation with default naming, compression levels, progress, cancellation, and automatic conflict numbering
- `Fixed` ZIP listings now use directory metadata and handle self-extracting-style preambles, legacy filename encodings, Windows separators, and more readable ZIP methods
- `Fixed` ZIP filename encoding can be overridden when automatic detection is wrong, and extraction reuses the selected encoding
- `Fixed` Unknown or imprecise sizes, valid DocumentsProvider URIs, and extra host write grants no longer reject a valid archive before parsing
- `Fixed` ZIP browsing and extraction now work on Android 7.x without calling runtime APIs that only exist on newer systems
- `Improved` Removed the fixed 4 GiB input cap and browse-time extraction-size/ratio gates while retaining path containment, integrity checks, and failure cleanup
- `Improved` Added a checkable Roadmap and rewrote README and CHANGELOG to separate current behavior from planned work
- `Improved` The transitional standalone screen now follows system day/night mode and Material dynamic colors
- `Improved` ZIP output streams through a UID-bound host session to same-directory temporary output and commits atomically without storage permission or overwriting existing files
- `Improved` Archive format and entry capabilities are checked consistently across preview, extraction, and creation, so unavailable options stay disabled
- `Improved` Archive failures identify the format, processing stage, stable code, and reason; debug builds can copy complete diagnostics
